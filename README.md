# PanModel33
Hello! this is an eco-evolutionary model developed at the University of Potsdam, Germany. It was designed for theory development, communication and learning.

To install and learn to use the model, please visit the document "user_manual.pdf" in this repository.

For a detailed explanation of model features, check the "odd_protocol.pdf"

Update:
Only the simple version, that uses native netlogo functions only, is available in this repositoty. One can comment out the corresponding lines of code in order to use the r extension as it was implemented for the previous "full" model version.
